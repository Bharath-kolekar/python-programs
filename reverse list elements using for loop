for i in range(length // 2):
    my_list[i], my_list[length - i - 1] = my_list[length - i - 1], my_list[i]

print(my_list)
###
Note:

we've assigned the length variable with the current list's length (this makes our code a bit clearer and shorter)
we've launched the for loop to run through its body length // 2 times (this works well for lists with both even and odd lengths, 
because when the list contains an odd number of elements, the middle one remains untouched)
we've swapped the ith element (from the beginning of the list) with the one with an index equal to (length - i - 1) (from the end of the list); 
in our example, for i equal to 0 the (length - i - 1) gives 4; for i equal to 1, it gives 3 â€’ this is exactly what we needed.

#example

my_list = []  # Creating an empty list.

for i in range(15):
    my_list.insert(0, i + 1)

print(my_list)
total = 0

for i in my_list:
    total += i
print(total)

length = len(my_list)
for i in range(length // 2):
    my_list[i], my_list[length -i -1] = my_list[length -i -1], my_list[i]
print(my_list)

#output
